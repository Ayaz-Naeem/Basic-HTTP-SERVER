# Basic-HTTP-SERVER
This Python code implements an HTTP server that handles login sessions. It allows users to log in, creates sessions with unique IDs, and checks for session validity upon subsequent requests. 
The server handles GET requests to access files in specified directories based on the user's session. 
The logs track successful logins, failed attempts, file access, and expired sessions.
